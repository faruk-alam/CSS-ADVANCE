Responsive Web Design - Images

Using The width Property
If the width property is set to a percentage and the height property is set to "auto", the 
image will be responsive and scale up and down:

Using The max-width Property
If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never 
scale up to be larger than its original size
