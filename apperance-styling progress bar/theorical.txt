The appearance CSS property is used to display an element using platform-native styling, 
based on the operating system's theme. The -moz-appearance and -webkit-appearance 
properties are non-standard versions of this property, used (respectively) by Gecko 
(Firefox) and by WebKit-based (e.g., Safari) and Blink-based (e.g., Chrome, Opera) 
browsers to achieve the same thing. Note that Firefox and Edge also support -webkit-
appearance, for compatibility reasons.


The -moz-appearance property was used in XUL stylesheets to design custom widgets with 
platform-appropriate styling. It was also used in the XBL implementations of the widgets 
that ship with the Mozilla platform. Starting with Gecko/Firefox 80, these uses were 
changed to -moz-default-appearance, which should never be used outside of internal 
stylesheets.

Note: If you wish to use this property on websites, you should test it very carefully. 
Although it is supported in most modern browsers, its implementation varies. In older 
browsers, even the keyword none does not have the same effect on all form elements across 
different browsers, and some do not support it at all. The differences are smaller in the 
newest browsers.
