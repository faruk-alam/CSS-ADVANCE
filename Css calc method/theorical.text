CSS calc() Method:

It is an inbuilt CSS function which allows us to perform calculations. It can be used to 
calculate length, percentage, time, number, integer frequency, or angle. It uses the four 
simple arithmetic operators add (+), multiply (*), subtract (-), and divide (/).
Syntax
calc(Parameter Expression);  
Values
This CSS function takes a single parameter expression, and the result of this mathematical 
expression will be used as a value. It can be any simple expression using the four 
arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). The expression is mandatory to define.

All CSS Preprocessors do have math functions and they are pretty useful. But they arenâ€™t 
quite as powerful as native math. The most useful ability of calc() is its ability to mix 
units, like percentages and pixels. No Preprocessor will ever be able to do that. It is 
something that has to happen at render time.
